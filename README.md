# Weedware License

After knowing about [Beerware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beerware), I decided to create weedware. Based on the [first version](https://github.com/nu7hatch/weedwarelicense.org) created by [Kris Kovalik](http://github.com/nu7hatch), this is the final version:

    "THE WEED-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 420):
    <contact@email.me> wrote this file. As long as you retain this notice you
    can do whatever you want with this stuff as far as your usage is not related 
    to war, brutality or any other kind of crime or evil. 
    By using this work you agree to disseminate freedom and peace around the world.
    If we meet some day, and you think this stuff is worth it, you can invite me to
    light up a boge in return.

Stay focus and high on success!
